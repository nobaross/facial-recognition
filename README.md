# facial-recognition
This project is a deep learning-based facial recognition system that utilizes a Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in images and videos. The system is trained using a dataset of images and corresponding labels, with the goal of being able to accurately identify and match a given face to a particular individual.

The main script, deeptraining.py, is responsible for training the model using the dataset. The script loads the images and labels, and trains a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library. The trained model is then saved for future use.

The facedetector.py script is responsible for detecting faces in images and videos using the trained model and the Haar cascade classifier. The script loads the image or video, detects faces using the classifier, and then passes the detected faces to the trained model for recognition. The script also utilizes OpenCV library for image and video processing.

The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file is the trained classifier file that is used for face detection. The label_dict.txt and name_id_dict.txt files contain the mapping of labels to names and ID's respectively, and names.txt file contains the list of names of individuals in the dataset.

The trainningmodel.py file is responsible for creating and saving the deep learning model. The trial.py file is used for testing the model with new faces.

This facial recognition system can be applied in various real-life scenarios such as security systems, access control systems, and even in personal devices such as smartphones to unlock the device using facial recognition.

In the future, this system can be improved by incorporating other biometrics such as fingerprint or iris recognition for increased security. Additionally, the system can be optimized for real-time processing using edge computing, and can be integrated with other technologies such as augmented reality or artificial intelligence to enable new use cases.

Overall, this project demonstrates the capabilities of deep learning and haarcascade classifiers in facial recognition and its potential in various real-world applications.
deeptraining.py: This is the main script for training the facial recognition model. It loads the images and labels from the dataset and trains a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library. The trained model is then saved for future use.

facedetector.py: This script is responsible for detecting faces in images and videos using the trained model and the Haar cascade classifier. It loads the image or video, detects faces using the classifier, and then passes the detected faces to the trained model for recognition. It also utilizes OpenCV library for image and video processing.

haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: This is the trained classifier file that is used for face detection. The Haar cascade classifier is a machine learning object detection method used to identify objects in images or videos with a high degree of accuracy.

label_dict.txt: This file contains the mapping of labels to names. The labels are used to identify the individuals in the dataset, and this file provides a way to map the labels to the corresponding names.

name_id_dict.txt: This file contains the mapping of names to ID's. It is used to keep track of the identification of the individuals in the dataset.

names.txt: This file contains the list of names of individuals in the dataset. It is used to keep track of all the individuals that the model has been trained on.

trainningmodel.py: This file is responsible for creating and saving the deep learning model. It uses TensorFlow to define the architecture of the model, and trains the model using the dataset.

trial.py: This file is used for testing the model with new faces. It loads the trained model, detects faces in an image or video, and tries to recognize the faces using the model.

All of these files work together to build and test a deep learning-based facial recognition system. The system is trained on a dataset of images and labels, and is able to accurately recognize and match a given face to a particular individual. The haarcascade classifier and OpenCV library is used for detection of faces in images and videos and overall a powerful deep learning model is created to recognize faces.

To run this facial recognition system, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

Python: This project is written in Python, so you will need to have a version of Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

TensorFlow: This project uses TensorFlow, a popular open-source library for machine learning, to train the deep learning model. You can install TensorFlow by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

Install OpenCV by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:
Download and install Node.js and npm from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Clone the project from the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your command prompt or terminal.

Run the following command to install the project dependencies npm pip install
Run the following command to start the server:
To train the model, Run the deeptraining.py file with python
